# Contributing to Cloudflare API GUI

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Cloudflare API GUI. It's people like you that make Cloudflare API GUI such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Getting Started

Before you begin:
- Check out the [README.md](README.md) for a complete guide on how to get started with Cloudflare API GUI.
- Ensure you are not duplicating someone else's work. Look through the existing issues and pull requests.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Cloudflare API GUI? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub* series.

## Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:
1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    - Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    - Send a pull request.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email [admin@lukedurkin.co.uk](mailto:admin@lukedurkin.co.uk) instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Cloudflare API GUI are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Cloudflare API GUI, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Cloudflare API GUI has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis in a weekly triage meeting. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
